### FPL Optimisation using LP w/ Google OR Tools

## Setup

Still need to automate the venv setup, for now create yourself using instructions at `https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html`

Once you've created the venv, use `. start.sh` or `source start.sh` to activate and install all python dependencies

Use python ./engine.py to run the engine and watch the magic!
